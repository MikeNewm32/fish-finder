# Fish Finder README

## Heroku
<a href="https://fish-finder.herokuapp.com/"> Fish Finder </a>

## Reason
I created this app to aid in documenting where and how an angler was able to catch fish. An angler is able to attach photos and location information for bodies of water and also for the fish they catch. Doing so allows them to keep information for future trips.
